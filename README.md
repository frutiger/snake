# Snake

This is an implementation of the popular 'snake' game in Elm.  This project was
created purely for self-educational purposes.

## Build Instructions

The 'Elm' toolchain is a prerequisite.  Run the following command:

```bash
$ elm make app.elm ports.elm --output app.js
```

The `app.js` output along with `index.html` should work in any modern browser.
